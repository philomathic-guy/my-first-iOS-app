## Objective C conventions I learned about -
* **Class and method names** are much more descriptive than you might find with general C code functions or the C Standard Library, and **camel case is used for names with multiple words**
* Many Objective-C and framework features require you to follow **strict naming conventions** in order for various mechanisms to work correctly. Accessor method names, for example, must follow the conventions in order **to work with techniques such as Key-Value Coding (KVC) or Key-Value Observing (KVO).**
* **Objective-C classes must be named uniquely** not only within the code that you’re writing in a project, but also across any frameworks or bundles you might be including. As an example, you should avoid using generic class names like *ViewController* or *TextParser* because it’s possible a framework you include in your app may fail to follow conventions and create classes with the same names.
* In order **to keep class names unique**, the convention is to **use prefixes** on all classes such as NS, UI, AB, CA, CI. Your **own classes should use three letter prefixes**. These might relate to a combination of your company name and your app name, or even a specific component within your app. As an example, if your company were called Whispering Oak, and you were developing a game called Zebra Surprise, you might choose WZS or WOZ as your class prefix.
